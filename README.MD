##### WORTH MENTIONING

My code editor of choice is VSCode, but I'm also proficient in using Visual Studio when building `.NET` applications.

I've written some tests using `Jest`, But I have to admit that this is the one field I still have to learn and explore as I've hardly written any test on my projects.

##### What do you want from your next job?

I'm looking for front-end development or UX/UI designer positions, anything that'll allow me to work closely with other UX/UI Designers.

I'm really passionate about app design and have been teaching myself UX design for as long as I can remember. Any opportunity working with an experienced designer, no matter how brief would be invaluable to me.

# ABOUT ME

Use this section to help you stand out. Talk about what you are passionate about, how you got into this line of work, how you have progressed and the challenges you have overcome.

In a tweet, I'm a front-end developer obsessed with UX/UI design.

I studied software development in college and got hooked by the front-end of the stack early on.
I love seeing and building an application from Sketch to the working product.

I dream of being given the opportunity to work with actual designers to help expand my knowledge of UX/UI design which is the ultimate goal for me.

I consider myself a self-starter, but I'm always happy to collaborate on projects.
I've been working under the alias of `SWSSR` (pronounced swisser) for the past two years as an independent freelance web designer and developer.

Most of the work on my [portfolio](https://swssr.com) is self-initiated, that's how I've been pushing myself to become a better thinker.

My most recent project as October 2019 is a website and blog for _Black Child Fair Child_, a nonprofit organization based in Durban. This is a collaborative effort between me and Respective Media. My job is to design the official landing page and blog then later develop it using React, with a headless CMS as the backend. It's an awesome project for an amazing organization.
